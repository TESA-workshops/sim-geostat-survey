## Fisheries-independent trawl surveys {.columns-2}

- Conducted by many RFMOs
- Becoming increasingly important in stock assessment
- Very costly!
- General goal:
    - Maximize information & minimize expenses

```{r results = "asis"}
cat(boat_txt)
```


## Fisheries-independent trawl surveys {.columns-2}

- How much survey effort is enough?
    - Difficult to answer
        - Multi-stage sampling
        - Intra-haul correlation

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

```{r results = "asis"}
cat(boat_txt)
```


## Multi-stage sampling

Surveys are generally designed to:

## Intra-haul correlation

Sampling clusters of fish that have similar characteristics (e.g. length)

- Results in samples with positive intra-haul correlation
    - Reduces effective sample size

## **Reality is complicated** {data-background=graphics/school_light.png data-background-size=cover}

- **Dynamic abundance**
- **Spatial aggregation**
- **Survey design**
- **_Objective: build a simulation that emulates reality_**


## Simulation steps {.smaller}

1. **Simulate abundance**
    - Common cohort model
2. **Simulate spatial aggregation**
    - Includes depth associations and noise correlated across space, years and ages
3. **Simulate surveys**
    - Stratified random surveys with different sampling protocol
5. **Analyze**
    - Conduct stratified analyses and compare <a href="javascript:slidedeck.loadSlide(20)">truth vs. estimate</a>


## Simulate abundance

- Common cohort model
    - $N_{a,y} = N_{a-1,y-1} e^{-Z_{a-1,y-1}}$
- First year filled via exponential decay
    -  $N_{a,1} = N_{a-1,1} e^{-Z_{a-1,1}}$
- Random-walk in recruitment
    - $log(N_{1,y}) = log(\mu_r) + \epsilon_{y}$, where $\epsilon_{y} \sim N(\epsilon_{y - 1}, \sigma_{r}^{2})$
- Total mortality correlated across ages and years
    - $log(Z_{a,y}) = log(\mu_Z) + \delta_{a,y}$, where $\delta_{a,y} \sim N(0, \Sigma_{a,y})$
        - Using covariance, $\Sigma_{a,y}$, described in Cadigan [-@Cadigan2016]

## Simulate abundance {.tighter}

### Trend in total abundance

```{r}
plot_trend(sim) %>% 
  tight_layout(yaxis = list(rangemode = "tozero"),
               margin = list(l = 70, r = 0, t = 0, b = 40, pad = 0))
```


## Simulate abundance {.tighter}

### Trend in abundance at age

```{r}
plot_surface(sim) %>% tight_layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(range = c(1, 10))))
```


## Simulate spatial aggregation

- Generate a square grid of $s$ locations, resolution $R$ and a depth gradient
- Distribute population through space and add spatial-temporal noise
    - $log(N_{a,y,s}) = log(N_{a,y}) + \eta_{a,y,s}$
    - $\eta_{a,y,s}$ includes parabolic relationship with depth and covariance between ages, years and space
        - $\eta_{a,y,s} = \frac{(d_s - \mu_{d}) ^ 2}{2 \sigma_d^2} + \xi_{a,y,s}$
        - $\xi_{a,y,s}$ is a combination of Matérn covariance and the age-year covariance described in Cadigan [-@Cadigan2016]


## Simulate spatial aggregation {.tighter}

### Distribution for ages 1-6 in years 1-6

```{r}
plot_distribution(sim, ages = 1:6, years = 1:6, type = "heatmap") %>% 
  tight_layout(margin = list(l = 0, r = 0, t = 40, b = 0, pad = 0))
```


## Simulate survey

- Split grid into $N_{div}$ divisions and $N_{strat}$ depth-based strata
- Set allocation defined by specifying set density, $D_{sets}$
- Binomial sampling was used to simulate catch:
    - $n_{a,y,s} \sim Bin(N_{a,y,s}, \frac{A_{trawl}}{A_{cell}} q_a )$
    - Accounts for trawl size relative to cell size, $\frac{A_{trawl}}{A_{cell}}$, and catchability, $q_a$ (controlled using a logistic curve)
    
## Simulate survey

- Lengths simulated using the original von Bertalanffy growth curve [@Cailliet2006]:
    - $log(l) = log(l_{\infty} - (l_{\infty} - l_0) e^{-Ka}) + \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_{l}^2)$
- Sub-sampling is then conducted
    - A maximum number of lengths are measured per set, $M_{lengths}$
    - A maximum number of ages, $M_{ages}$, are sampled per length group, $l_{group}$, per division


## Simulate survey {.tighter}

### Catch in year 1 survey simulation 1

```{r}
plot_survey(sim) %>% 
  tight_layout(margin = list(l = 0, r = 0, t = 0, b = 40, pad = 0))
```


## Settings and analysis {.build}

- Roughly based simulation on 3Ps Cod
- A series of 175 surveys were tested

|      **Parameter name** |      **Symbol** |                                       **Setting** |
|:----------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
|             Set density |      $D_{sets}$ |    0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01 sets / km^2^ |
|  Length sampling effort |   $M_{lengths}$ |       5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 lengths / set |
|     Age sampling effort |      $M_{ages}$ |   2, 5, 10, 20, 50 ages / length group / division |


## Settings and analysis

- Each survey was run 1000 times over the same population
- Abundance estimates, $\hat{I}_{a,y,k}$, were obtained using a stratified analysis [@Smith1981]
- Used root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as a measure of the precision and bias of the abundance estimates from each survey:
    - $RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{ \sum_{a = 1}^{N_a} \sum_{y = 1}^{N_y} \sum_{k = 1}^{N_k} (\hat{I}_{a,y,k} - I_{a,y})^2}{N_a N_y N_k}}$
    - Where $I_{a,y}$ is the true abundance available to the survey
- Powered by R and worked into a package (https://github.com/PaulRegular/SimSurvey)


## Assumptions

>- Population is uniformly distributed within a cell
>- The survey is an instantaneous snapshot of the population
>- Fish are aged at random throughout the division within length bins
>- Ages are estimated without error
>- Trawl dimensions are perfectly standard

## Truth vs. estimate {.smaller}

### Recap

- **Sets = primary sampling unit**
    - Only way to improve stratified estimates of total abundance
    - Best way to improve stratified estimates of abundance at age
- **Increasing length sampling does not always improve estimates**
    - At low set densities, more is worse
    - At high set densities, more is better
- **Sampling effort affects both bias and percision**
    - Stratified estimates are supposed to be unbiased?!
    - May be related to age-specific clustering
    
## Check bias

### Turned off age-specific clustering

```{r}
main_sim <- sim
load("analysis/cod_sim_exports/2018-09-07_test/test_output.RData")
plot_age_strat_fan(sim, surveys = surveys$survey,
                   ages = 2:6, years = sim$years, select_by = "age",
                   plot_bgcolor = "transparent", paper_bgcolor = "transparent",
                   font = list(size = 14, family = "'Montserrat', sans-serif"))
```


## Check bias {.tighter}

### Turned off age-specific clustering

```{r}
plot_error_surface(sim, plot_by = "samples") %>% 
  tight_layout(scene = surface_scene,
               margin = list(l = 0, r = 0, t = 40, b = 0, pad = 0))
```


## Check bias

### Turned off age-specific clustering

- In this scenario, 
    - Bias is negligible
    - Increasing sub-sampling is always beneficial
        - No age-specific clustering means that one fish is as "effective" as the next
    - Sub-sampling fewer fish at more locations appears better than many fish at fewer locations
        - Though more sub-samples improve perception of the age-distribution, it does little to inform magnitude


## Check bias

Why is there bias in the main scenario? Why is extra sub-sampling sometimes useful / sometimes detrimental?

- Likely related to age-specific clustering
- Alternate analyses (e.g. ogmap, geostatistical models) may be able to account for such clustering and, therefore, provide estimates with less bias
- Requires further investigation


## Conclusions

Results suggest that 

- Stratified estimates are not always unbiased
- Sets are the most effective way to improve estimates
- Excessive sub-sampling may be detrimental if set density is low


## Conclusions

**Caution:** this simple simulation is far from perfect, focuses on one case study, and lacks a cost component

- Makes it difficult to be prescriptive
- Nonetheless, results echo the growing body of literature that concludes
    - Extra sub-sampling is an ineffective means of improving estimates because within-set samples are correlated
    - If the goal is to maximize information, it is likely better to stop collecting psudoreplicates and, instead, focus efforts on other species or the next set


## Potential future directions

- Tailor to other species and assess sampling protocol
- Add a time component to assess trade-offs / efficiency
- Assess the effects of
    - Missing strata
    - Variable trawl area
    - Random vs. stratified age sampling
- Use this as a platform to test spatial models
- Use as an operating model for an MSE
- Others?
