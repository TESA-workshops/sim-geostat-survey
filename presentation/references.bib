To reduce the costs of estimating the age of all fish collected (i.e., via direct aging), an age?length key (ALK) is often developed by directly aging only a subsample of fish and estimating the ages of the remaining fish based on observed lengths. Although this approach is common, there is little guidance in the literature for determining the appropriate total sample size and numbers of fish needed to directly age for each length bin. We developed a stochastic simulation to evaluate the sample-size requirement for using ALKs to estimate von Bertalanffy growth parameters and the instantaneous rate of total mortality (Z). The simulations accounted for variation in life history characteristics of stocks and exploitation rates of fisheries. Our simulations suggested that for overfished populations, aging more fish per bin provides negligible benefits whereas collecting larger total sample sizes could improve bias and precision of Z estimates. These results also indicated that bias and precision was relatively uninfluenced by fish life history type, which may allow for standardization of field collection methods across a wide range of fish species. In most cases, total sample sizes of 500?1,000 and 10 fish aged per bin provided near optimal performance in accuracy and precision, suggesting that this could be a guideline for many studies.

abstract = {This study examines the effect of survey design on the precision of estimates of average weight of stomach contents of fish. Since prey distribution is often patchy, fish at a station tend to have more similar stomach contents than do fish from different stations. Theory for evaluating the effects of intra-cluster correlation and variable density on the variance of estimates of average stomach contents is developed, and the implications for stomach sampling programs are examined. It is demonstrated that because of intra-cluster correlation the number of stations, more so than number of stomachs collected, determines the precision of estimated average stomach contents. As an example, the survey design for estimating the average amount of capelin (Mallotus villosus) in Barents Sea cod (Gadus morhua) stomachs in the winter is assessed, using survey data from years with high and low capelin abundance. The results, in agreement with the theoretical findings, show that precision would be maximized for fixed cost if fewer fish were collected from each station, and the freed resources were used to collect fish from as many stations as possible. In 1992, the survey design was changed accordingly; stomachs are now collected from twice as many stations, but the total number of stomachs collected has been reduced. Sampling fewer stomachs at each station enables most stomachs to be analyzed at sea. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Acoustic and bottom trawl surveys of the Northeast Arctic cod stock provide fishery independent estimates of abundance and population characteristics. Given the recent uncertainties in the catch based assessment of the stock, survey based abundance estimates of ages 5+ cod and spawning stook biomass, generated by calibrating survey indices with converged estimates from a virtual population analysis (VPA), were compared with the estimates front the annual assessments. The results indicate that the survey-based estimates were more accurate than the estimates from the annual assessments. Since the VPA abundance estimates for younger cod tend to be inaccurate, the amount of information contained in the surveys was tested indirectly determining how well estimates based on previous survey indices could predict the following year's survey value. A time-series model of ages 3+ cod and haddock survey indices predicted the subsequent value of the cod survey index fairly accurately. It is concluded that it is likely that these fishery independent surveys are providing a more accurate assessment of the current size of the cod stock than the assessment based on combining the survey data with commercial catch statistics.

Many surveys also collect selected body structures for in-lab age determinations for selected species. We provide examples from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center's (NEFSC) bottom trawl survey that detail the development of at-sea sampling to elucidate age, growth, maturity, fecundity, spawning season, stomach contents, diet composition, condition, habitat types and prey preferences, basic oceanography (or limnology), and bioenergetics for a suite of diverse species. We show how the development of new methodologies and technologies has decreased both deck-time and time in the lab for processing many of the samples required to provide information on the topics listed above. As new technologies develop to make our trawl catch processing more efficient, we assert that we can notably increase the amount of information collected from trawl surveys with little additional effort. We show that with marginally additional catch processing time on the deck, at-sea sampling can provide a significant return on the knowledge of aquatic and marine resource species, non-resource species, habitats, food webs, and the ecosystems within which they occur. As observing systems continue to expand their remit to provide ecosystem management advice, the need for increased efficiencies on fisheries surveys will remain.},

abstract = {Ideas and considerations are put forward for managing fisheries and marine populations using primarily trawl surveys to supply biological and spatial indicators of the state of stocks, and to permit catch per unit effort (CPUE)-based assessments. Trawl surveys seldom allow absolute estimates of fish population sizes but, if appropriately located, timed, and designed, can provide a broad range of information about catchable fish species and the ecosystem that supports them. This information may be more conducive to sustainable management of fisheries than the traditional focus on the abundances of selected stocks. The paper first briefly proposes how survey-based methods might supplement existing fishery-dependent stock assessments, as would be necessary during a transition phase to a more ecosystem-orientated system of management. Full survey-based management is then considered in relation to management objectives, the selection of indicators, survey design, reference periods, levels and directions, statistical aspects, CPUE-based assessments, and management responses to good and bad signals from the ecosystem. We argue that existing fishery-dependent stock assessments cannot be claimed to produce absolute estimates of stock abundance and fishing mortality because natural mortality (M) is seldom known accurately and, therefore, that they should not be presumed superior to the relative information from surveys, and an agreeable form of adaptive management.},

abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

For many fisheries, assessments based on catch data, even those incorporating survey data, are quite variable and may give a misleading picture of the health of the entire stock. Though abundance estimates generated by marine surveys are also variable, they often appear to track abundance trends more accurately than techniques that use catch data. Some statistical methods for analyzing survey data are briefly reviewed and comparative case studies of the assessments of the Newfoundland northern cod stock, the Namibian hake stocks, and Barents Sea cod and haddock are presented.

abstract = {For many deep-water species it is impractical to conduct scientific surveys to assess the state of the stocks. Therefore, the only means available to monitor these species is through assessing changes in the commercial catch composition over time. A pilot study was conducted to determine a suitable sampling strategy for estimating the age and length distribution of the commercial catch of ling, tusk and blue ling in the northeast Atlantic. Based on this study, it is shown that the precision of estimates of the length distribution is a function of not just the number of fish sampled but more importantly, how the fish were sampled. It appears that the most efficient survey design is to collect relatively small samples from as many vessels as possible. For example, the standard error for estimating the mean length of tusk if based on approximately 20,000 fish sampled from fishing trips made by 3 vessels would be 1.61, while if 5000 fish were collected from trips made by 5 vessels, the standard error would be equal to 1.26. The gain in precision by spreading out the sampling is due to the fact that fish caught in a particular small area tend to be more similar than those in the entire population. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Integrated stock assessment models derive estimates of management quantities by fitting to indices of abundance and length and age compositions. For composition data, where a multinomial likelihood is often applied, weights are determined by input sample sizes, which can be an important contributor to model results. We used a generic bootstrap method, verified through simulation, to calculate year-specific maximum realized sample sizes from the observation error inherent in fishery biological data. Applying this method to length-composition observations for 47 groundfish species collected during a standardized trawl survey, we found maximum realized sample size to be related to both the number of hauls and individual fish sampled from those hauls. Sampling in excess of 20 fish from each haul produced little increase in most cases, with maximum realized sample size ranging from approximately 2 to 4 per haul sampled. Utilizing these maximum realized sample sizes as input values for stock assessment (analogous to minimum variance estimates) appropriately incorporates interannual variability, and may reduce over-emphasis on composition data. Results from this method can also help determine sampling targets. (English)},

abstract = {Many fish stock assessments are based on numbers at age from research sampling programmes and samples from commercial catches. However, only a small fraction of the catch is typically analyzed for age as this is a costly and time-consuming process. Larger samples of the length distribution and a so-called age-length key (ALK) is then used to obtain the age distribution. Regional differences in ALKs are not uncommon, but stratification is often problematic due to a small number of samples. Here, we combine generalized additive modelling with continuation ratio logits to model the probability of age given length and spatial coordinates to overcome these issues. The method is applied to data gathered on North Sea haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), cod (Gadus morhua), whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and herring (Clupea harengus) and its implications for a simple age-based survey index of abundance are examined. The spatial varying ALK outperforms simpler approaches with respect to AIC and BIC, and the survey indices created using the spatial varying ALK displays better internal and external consistency indicating improved precision. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore the application of bootstrap methods to analyse of errors in trawl survey indices of abundance at age, with focus on the relative participation of the three sampling levels: haul design, sampling of lengths and sampling of ages, and their implications for survey accuracy. The method consists of resampling these three sources of variability, independently and together, following the sampling scheme and comparing the results. Our results show that although the haul design component is the main source of variability of abundance at age, the importance of catch sampling (sampling of lengths and ages) may be substantial, especially at low abundance levels. Furthermore, we have used our method as a survey simulator; as an example we have performed a simulation with an alternative sampling scheme, i.e. reducing the tow duration and spending the saved time performing more hauls. The simulation shows that the alternative scheme improves the accuracy of abundance at age. This survey simulator may be used as a tool to evaluate other alternative sampling schemes. We have used the cod (Gadus morhua) data from the Flemish Cap survey as a case study but the method may be adapted to different survey procedures. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Indices of abundance from fishery-independent trawl surveys constitute an important source of information for many fish stock assessments. Indices are often calculated using area stratified sample means on age-disaggregated data, and finally treated in stock assessment models as independent observations. We evaluate a series of alternative methods for calculating indices of abundance from trawl survey data (delta-lognormal, delta-gamma, and Tweedie using Generalized Additive Models) as well as different error structures for these indices when used as input in an age-based stock assessment model (time-constant vs time-varying variance, and independent versus correlated age groups within years). The methods are applied to data on North Sea herring (Clupea harengus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and the full stock assessments are carried out to evaluate the different indices produced. The stratified mean method is found much more imprecise than the alternatives based on GAMs, which are found to be similar. Having time-varying index variances is found to be of minor importance, whereas the independence assumption is not only violated but has significant impact on the assessments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
