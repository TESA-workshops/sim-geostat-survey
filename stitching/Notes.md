# Notes
Sample N and S in alternating years
Is this possible?
Does sampling both areas in one year help?

Goal - sdmTMB gives us both area-specific index and global index
Estimation model should estimate (extrapolate) abundance in missing strata in missing years

We control the operating model and where/when the missing observations are


# Question 1:
- Same vessel samples both areas annually
- Different q between areas

# Question 2:
- Same vessel samples different areas in alternating years
- Different q between areas

# Question 3:
- Same vessel samples different areas in alternating years, one year in common
- Different q between areas

# Question 4:
- Same vessel samples different areas in alternating years, one year in common
- Compare to global survey with half the set density (same effort)
- Different q between areas

# Question 5:
- Same vessel samples different areas in alternating years, one year in common in the same area
- Different q between areas

# Question 6:
- Same vessel samples different areas in alternating years, one year both surveys sample both areas
- Different q between areas
